## Outline of talk {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

- What is a military operation?

- The demand of the military soldier

- Determinants of military readiness

- Benefit of maintaining physical fitness

- Training strategies during deployment to preserve physical fitness and military readiness

- Practical application

::: {.fragment}

Narrowing the scope:


- Physiological fitness is defined as strength and endurance related variables

- Military personnel are not being categorized into their military occupational specialties

- Will not delve into biological mechanisms occurring during operations (i.e. hormones)

:::

::: {.notes}

- To get an understanding of this assignment and why the physical fitness is of importance for the soldier, we need to start with what is characterizing a military operations.

- and then we look into the demand of the modern soldier

- so will I talk about determinants of military readiness

- Before I talk about the benefit of maintaining physical fitness

- I will then talk about training strategies to maintain physical fitness during prolonged operations

- before I ending up with a practical application  


"click" to narrowing the scope a little bit, 

- Physiological fitness is defined as strength and endurance related variables

- Military personnel are not being categorized into their military occupational specialties

### "What are the short- and long-term benefits of maintaining physical fitness for military personnel during prolonged [operations]{.alert}, and what strategies are most effective?"


::: {.notes}

- To get an understanding of what an operation is, we need to see how it i characterized....

:::

## Military operations {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### Range of military operations (ROMO)

![](fig/operation.png)

-   The conflict continuum forms the operation (inspired by doctrine.af.mil)

::: notes


- So, a military operation is not a fixed situation. IT continuously varies in degrees of intensity and complexity on a day or weekly basis. 

- On the one side we have, Stable Peace, with LOW intensity and complexity of the conflict,

- Moving along this line to the right, the intensity/complexity of the conflict increases towards maximum, which is war time..

:::

## Military operations {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### What characterizes these operations

![](fig/new/new_level_2.png){.absolute width="650" left=-5}



::: {.fragment .absolute top=390}

1\. Military engagement

 - routine military activities (day-to day conflict tension low)
 
:::

::: {.fragment .absolute top=480}

2\. Crisis response

 - peace enforcement (i.e. noncombat evacuation, peace operations)

:::

::: {.fragment .absolute top=570}

3\. Major operations

 - often large-scale or long duration operations (often associated with wartime conditions)

:::

::: notes

- Along this continuum we ha different levels of operations...

1.  "click", in the first level: the military is engaged to control tension between groups, predominately without force, and often involve being deployed in foreign country. BUT, the Day to day conflict tension is low.

2. "click", moving to the right, the conflict level increases and the soldiers readiness level is elevated, it typically involves small-scale operations, of limited duration, such as nonbombat evacuations..

3.  "click" far right, there is sustained operations in conflict with other nations or groups, it is often a *series* of operations aimed to restore security, and strategic positions within a given time, this is often associated with full wartime..

:::


-   Military readiness is dependent of soldiers' physical fitness

::: notes

- "click", Along with the increasing tension in a conflict, the soldier must constantly cope with an increased degree of intensity and complexity of the operation.

- Meaning the soldier needs to be ready for the demands of the operations both physically and mentally, AND this defines the soldiers military readiness. Which must be sustained irrespective of where they are in this conflict continuum. 

- And to sustain this military readiness over time,"click" it demands that the soldiers physical fitness level is maintained as high as possible *independent* of being in this stable peace area (POINT) with low intensity of conflict or mowing towards maximum intensity and complexity in war time.. 

- So this demand line of fitness need to be high to ensure soldiers military readiness, as the conflict may move from left to right very fast..

![](fig/new/new_read.png){.absolute bottom=50 right=0}

::: {.notes}

So, the demand of having a high physical fitness is closely connected with soldiers military readiness 

- And, know let us look into how the demand of soldiers physical fitness has evolved on the modern battlefield

## Military operations {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### Demands of physical fitness - has increased

::: {.r-stack}


![](fig/benefit/civil.png){.fragment .fade-in-then-out}



![](fig/new/demand_load.png){.fragment}

:::


Figure from [@RN1615;@RN1633]


::: {.notes}

- "click", from the WWI until freedom operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (point), there is seen an linear increase in load carried on soldiers body

- This is mainly due to development of advanced protective body armor and weapon systems - which has lead to load carried on body has increased from around 5 kg up to 30 kg over the last 100 years..

- as a matter of fact, there is reported that soldiers during a 1 year deployment are in average carrying daily around 22 kg extra load on body compared to garrison duty..

- "click", so , consequently, the extra load carried is putting daily an extra physiologically stress on the soldier, thus maintaining the demand for high physiological fitness

::: 

 
## Military readiness {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### Demands of physical fitness - anaerobic battlefield


![](fig/benefit/spec.png)

- Technology and equipment

- Fast moving to the objective



::: {.notes}

- Furthermore has the real-world mission requirements with new technology and equipment emphasized a higher need for anaerobic capacity, especial in the special forces...

- Instead of walking long distances to the enemy objectives, soldiers are now transported close to the target. Wherein the soldier, with combat gear are moving fast up/down buildings or terrain in offensive or defensive maneuvers. 

- Consequently the anaerobic requirements is elevated, adding another demand on the soldier physical fitness capacity

:::



## Military operations {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### Demands of physical fitness - heavy tasks


![](fig/new/demand_heavy.png)

- Increased physically demanding tasks

- Heavy duties increase 12-22% compared to garrison duties

[@RN1633]

::: {.notes}

- Additionally increases the demand for performing heavy tasks during deployment

- there is reported 12-22% increase in physical demanding tasks during deployment compared to garrison duties

- hence, adding an extra physiological stress on the soldier

:::



## Military working demands {background-color="#107895"}

- What is your working demand in your filed of expertise?

    - Spend two minutes to discuss - reflect upon this question


## Outline of talk {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

- The demand of the military soldier

- **Determinants for military readiness**

- Benefit of maintaining physical fitness

- Training strategies during deployment to preserve physical fitness and military readiness

- Practical application



![](fig/new/demand_heavy.png){.absolute height="250" bottom=30 right=0}



::: {.notes}

- All these demands which has increased gradually with the modern battlefield thus highlight the need for high physical fitness during deployment, and will thus also affect soldiers military readiness..


So, know we need FURTHER define the determinants for military readiness..

### Determinants for military readiness

![](fig/new/body_dem_2.png){.fragment fragment-index=1 .absolute height="450" left=0}

::: {.notes}

- "click", As we see the military readiness is dependent on a high physical fitness level irrespective of degree of conflict. This fitness status is built on the soldiers strength and endurance capacities (pooint).

:::




## Determinants for military readiness {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### Strength and endurance factors


Strength capacity

- Moderate to strong correlations (r > 0.4)
:::

[Data from: @RN1614;@RN730;@RN1431;@RN1618;@RN1619]


::: {.notes}

- This is because, soldiers' strength and endurance capacity are found to be associated with several occupational and combat like tasks.

- to highlight that, I plotted data from several studies looking into this relationship.

- and  we can see that maximal strength have been found to have a moderate to strong correlation with many combat-like tasks..POINT-examples, repeated lift, load carry, crawl, dig, movefast

- meaning are you stronger you would also likely perform better in these military performance outcomes...

- A strong argument for sustaining strength capacity during deployment and ensure military readiness

- However, there is more determinant factors that will affect soldiers military readiness and also  challenge the maintenance of high physical fitness.. 

- "click", with the increased intensity and complexity in the conflict area, moving towards the right side, additional factors will simultaneously increase and challenge soldiers military readiness "click".

-These factors increases concurrently with the intensity of the conflict, such as, POINT, increases in sleep deprivation, energy deficit, recovery deficit, along with the duration of operations, and increases in physical strenous activitites. "click", 

- This factors alone or in combination will induce a physiological stress on the soldier, which affects soldiers military readiness

-  To get an idea how the multi-stress factors affects the soldiers physical fitness and readiness, we have in several years performed field exercise studies.

- "click", Field exercise studies is meant to train and prepare the soldier for the real world battlefield operations, and thus the soldier is exposed for several of these stressors experienced during high intensity conflicts, simultaneously...

2.  Fitness tests can also be used as metrics for other constructs of job success such as injury risk, attrition, absenteeism and mortality [p149 hauschild2017]

This makes physiologic sense given that aerobic metabolism increasingly becomes the dominant source of energy for tasks lasting more than a few minutes (hauschil2017 p150)

LBstrength is strongly correlated with more occupational tasks and therefore may be more important test consideration (hauschild2017)

::: {.notes}

- So to be able to maintain physical fitness and achieve these benefit and hence sustain military readiness, we can use different training strategies which is implemented under these circumstances both under the LOW and HIGH conflict areas..  

- Ok, so let us look into possible training strategies to use,  and what have been done before in some deployment studies

:::

## Strategies for maintaining physical fitness {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### Training principles

![](fig/benefit/principles.png){}

::: {.notes}


- Ok, these training strategies revolve around three main principles designed to give your body the right kind of stimuli to trigger changes in your neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory system. 

- And will thus have an effect on maintaining this physical fitness demand (point)

- For.example, we can induce a stimuli to these body systems by including repeated bouts with progressive OVERLOAD, that subsequently would enhance structural adaptations over time.

- We can also use the principle of specificity of training. Where we replicate the movement pattern of a specific task, which progressively increase in intensity. Over time this would stimulate the neurmuscular system to adapt and enhance performance in THAT specific task

- And, to reduce training monotomy and stagnation in adaptations, the periodization strategy, is often applied in training plans. Wherein the purpose is to systematically vary in training modalities, exercise, intensity and volume, to ensure variation in training stimuli and thus enhance development of adaptations over time. This may also may reduce the potential for overtraining

:::

::: {.notes}

- In particular have the periodization model, block periodization, been recommended for soldiers to use both before and during deployment periods

- With block periodization the soldier can in different periods work with different focus, with the aim to maximize a physiological capacity, while maintaining other capacities simultaneously

- "click", this has frequently been shown to be effective in athletes

- and has shown to improve both strength and endurance capacitites simultainously, which is of importance since soldiers need to maintain both capacities to ensure military readiness

::: {.notes}

- But, why this drop in aerobic capacity, "click",

- We see that some early studies around 2010, soldiers report to train less aerobic during deployment compared to garrison duty.

- 88 percent of soldies trained under garrison, pre-deployment
- while 29% performed endurance training deployed

- Hence the training volume drops...

- "click", Whereas for strength there is a lower or no drop between pre and deployment..

- Why is it so, "click", one reason could be the low air quality in these countries and the solders were actually obligated not to perform aerobic exercise due to respiratory health concerns.

- another, reason, which is speculated upon in the papers, could be related to that better fit soldiers entering deployment period does not have sufficient training stimuli during deployment to maintain their capacity..

- while the more sustained or improved strength outcomes, could in this regard, be related to lower fit soldiers entering the deployment period, and achieved adaptations by repeated overload stimulus by doing more heavy task assignment during the deployment period

- Another training strategy which can be implemented during deployment, is the task specific training, aligning with the idea of "train as you will fight."

1. Throughout time load carriage has shown to be an essential occupational task for soldiers during military operations. 

2. "click", Meaning there is a need to specific train for this loading task, which can be done by performing similar repetitive loading movements in the training programs, thus facilitating the neuromuscular system to adapt and then perform better in that particular movement task..

3. "click" This can eventually lead to better sustained force output, as the task would be relatively easier to perform with the soldiers better skill performance

4. "click" repeated movement training, can also reduce risk of injury

5. "click" consequently, the soldier would be better prepared to handle the battlefield military tasks and requirements (military readiness)

6. this specificity of training on improving occupational tasks, was investigated in a military population by Ojanen.

- Soldiers need more flexibility than athletes [@RN1628;@RN1014]

- Acute situations and stressors affects soldiers readiness for training


::: {.notes}

- Well as we know, due to the soldier may not be in a physiologically optimal state to train systematically every week, because of the increased intensity and complexity with the conflict level, The soldier need more flexibility in their training plan in such periods."click"

- so by having more flexible session, POINT, which can be performed on a day to day basis depending on circumstances and how the soldiers physiologically state is, is an interesting method

- "click show", This could be a more optimal training strategy for the soldier, wherein sessions can be performed between these demanding operations, wherein a training window is possible.

- This is likely the closet the soldier can come to an anabolic window, where the stress factors is minimized during times where there is more frequent operations occurring

- And thus, gives the soldier an opportunity to maintain his physical fitness

:::


## Flexible periodization model during deployment {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### Suggestion of a flexible program

![](fig/new/flex_mod.png)

::: {.notes}

- So, an example of a possible model for this flexibility I draw up this model.. .

- Over a given mescocyle (i.e. 6 weeks) the soldier, together with his commandor, have set a specific training goal which the soldier try to maintain or even improve if possible.

- Then the soldier have three alternative session to switch between; hard, moderate and easy session, which varies in intensity and volume

- then the individual soldier choose which session to conduct on a day to day basis, taken into account their physiological state and which stressors they have operated in the last days...

- for.exe, on hard and long day in the field, they choose the easy session, with focus on UB strength for instance

- while another day, feeling more recovered, a hard session program can be performed, for.ex 2-days in a row in this time window

- In conjunction to this limited time window between operations, short-micro training cycle method could be a pertinent strategy to induce some training stimuli to maintain physical fitness.

- The micro training cycle method consists of very short training session.

![](fig/new/flex_2.png)

- My be a good alternative during time restricted periods during deployment

- Some training time is better than nothing



::: {.notes}


- So this can be a valuable strategy, with short frequent sessions, which can be implemented in short breaks during the day or between operations for example

- taken together, the soldier would likely have some benefit of this training strategy as some training is likely better than nothing

### Recovery aspect following operations


![](fig/stress_3.png)

- NOTABLY  
- Post demanding operations:  
      - Recovery days (optimal 1-2 weeks)

::: {.notes}

- However in regard to these training windows between operations, we know from these field exercise studies, that the body needs several days to recover, 

- often it takes, 1-2 weeks before the body is fully recovered and returned to pre operation body mass and muscular performance levels

- So, I would recommend there is some time restrictions that need to be followed to reduce risk of injury or delay the recovery process unnecessary...

- and perhaps, more IMPORTANLTY, delay soldiers active duty readiness

:::


## Summary of flexible periodisation {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

- Advantage:
      
    - The commandor knows that the soldier is doing training to maintain physical fitness over a certain time period 
    - Easier to control recovery and mitigate overtraining
      
::: {.fragment}      

- Disadvatage:
    
    - The commandor does not know wheter the training is done
    - There is a risk that the soldier frequently choose the easy session (unmotivated)
:::


::: {.fragment} 
- Suggestion to increase training motivation:
    
    - maybe include frequent testing of physical fitness during deployment?
    - to motivate progression in training

:::

:::  {.notes}


- So an advantage of using flexible training model is that "The commandor knows that the soldier is doing training to maintain physical fitness over a certain time period"

-  AND, Easier to control recovery and mitigate overtraining


- "click", The commandor does not know whether the training is done

- There is a risk that the soldier frequently choose the easy session, due to low motivation

so to increase motivation: 
    - maybe include frequent testing of physical fitness during deployment?  
    - then the soldier can have some extra motivation to continue training progression

## What we do pre-doplyment is also of importance {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

### A high baseline in physical fitness

![](fig/benefit/reserve.png)

::: {.notes}

1. A last strategy, which could prepare the soldier for the physical demand and maybe better preserve military readiness during deployment, can be to ensure that the soldiers have as HIGH physical fitness level as possible, BEFORE entering the deployment period.

2. Thus the soldier may have a higher physical capacity than the demand when entering de deployment period (POINT)

- The drop can tell us something about the baseline

- Baseline physical fitness need to be high
    - Delay drop in physical fitness during operations?
    - To better preserve readiness during deployment


[@RN1097;@RN1621;@RN185]


:::


:::



::::


::: {.notes}

 
1. an initial higher baseline, have more relatively strength or endurance capacities to loose, and the soldier may thus maintain physical 
demand longer by having a "reserve physical capacity" when entering the deployment period (POINT)

2. as illustrated here in soldier 1 and 2..., wherein soldier 1 better preserve physical fitness and readiness at a given time.

3. So, Sufficient training ahead of deployment is of importance, and can not be overlooked in this regard..

4. and thus is a strategy to mitigate loss of military readiness  

enough  

2. the importance of high physical fitness at baseline, can be supported by what is seen during intake of recruits to the Norwegian Special Forces.  
Those individuals who have a higher physical fitness level at baseline, did also display a greater possibility to successfully complete extreme demanding training periods

## Practical application {.smaller background-color="#107895"}

**Training strategies:**

::: {.fragment}

- Create mesocyles with specific training goals for the individual soldier

:::

::: {.fragment}

- Make 3-4 alternative session (easy to hard) which can be chosen by the soldier depending on his/her physiological readiness

:::

::: {.fragment}

- Short micro session is probably better than no training session

:::

::: {.fragment}

Notably:

- A short recovery period following demanding operations is necessary, to minimize delayed recovery and military readiness

:::


::: {.fragment}

- Initial fitness level must be optimized as good as possible before entering a deployment period

## Thank you {.smaller background-color="#107895"}



## da mener vi vel for å vedlikeholde physical fitness (strength, endurance, vektlegg mer denne session?){.smaller background-color="#107895" visibility="hidden"}

- dra inn igjen operation figure



-   definerer vi det som å vedlikeholde/bedre physical fitness (strength, endurance)

-   forutsetning for å gjøre fysisk trening, at kroppen/indre miljø er i balance, anabolske forutsetinger for adaptasjoner...?

-   derfor bør fokus være i mer rolige perioder, hvor man er i balanse?

-   concurrent training (long term?)

-   peridoization strategies (non linear, flexible periodization, volume lavt-høy intensitet?)

-   nutrient strategeies (i følge pihlainen så er det manglende studier på dette i deployments (avgrense tror jeg og ikke bry seg om dette nå))

-   philainen 2022, Myllyla2023 har sett på trenining i lengrevarende operasjoner/deployments

    -   de vedlikholder styrke, men motivasjon kan være avgjørende (indre motivasjon til soldat, pluss lederen)
    - mer testing under deplyoyments, ytre motivasjon...



::: {.notes}

-   As such, the demanded level of physical performance (e.g., functional reserve) may not be maintained during operations lasting several months just by performing the given military duties. Future *studies focusing on training interventions*, aiming to maintain or improve physical performance during military operations, are warranted (for.eks .

-   collaborations of allies often obligates soldiers to deploy internationally which requires these soldiers to content with multiple stressors (e.g. physical, psychological, environmental, nutritional etc.).

:::



## 3. Physiological demands during deployments (stressors?) {.smaller background-color="#107895" visibility="hidden"}

### What are the soldiers challenges during deplyments

-   Increases in physiological demands during operations

    -   time with external load (average 22kg nagai etal)
    -   physically demanding tasks (from 12 to 22% boye etal)
    -   

-   environmental extremes (heat, cold, altitude)

-   musculoskeletal injuries

-   post-traumatic stress disorders

-   Mental

-   Environment extremes

::: notes
-   demands increases during with increased soldiers

-   Maintenance of physical fitness and body composition

-   rigors of external load carriage

    -   one of major challenges throughout history has been the requirement to carry an external load into combat. There have been an linear increase in soldiers loads over time.
    -   The negative consequences of excessive load carriage can include decreased mobility, increased fatigue, foot blisters, spinal injury and degeneration, muscle tightness, and soreness of the legs, feet, back, and shoulders..

-   environmental extremes (heat, cold, and altitude)

-   musculoskeletal injuries (large part, 82.3% of evacuations were non battle injury or illness, 17.7% was battle injury) Nindl 2013.

-   traumatic brain injuries

-   post-traumatic stress disorder

A full understanding of these responses, will assist in identifying the most effective risk mitigation strategies to ensure deployment readiness
